# ECG-monitoring-device
A flexible wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device was developed using Multi-Walled Carbon NanoTube based dry electrodes and a flexible printed circuit board (PCB) module integrated into a fabric chest belt. An android mobile application to display an ECG graph is also developed using MIT App Inventor 2 IDE.
